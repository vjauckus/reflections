When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would prefer to work in remote mode, when:
    - if I work in cooperation with other programmers,
    - if I work on business trip with a notebook and not with local PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because some changes are experemintal and just a trial. I want to deside by myselfe to public or not my changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When you say you are Forking a repository you are basically creating a copy of the repository under your GitHub ID. Forked project is on our online repository. 
    The Fork & Pull Model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. 
    The source repository will not get my commits, because I don't have permission to change Larry's repository! The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer.

	A clone is where you have proper duplication, and separation between, two (possibly different) versions of a repository. After forking we can clone the forked repository locally on our machine.
	Clone can be done local as copy of the same project/repository or per remote from server.

	Branches are working in a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
